Pandoras box started as a hobby project to teach myself the basics of hardware security. The PCB requires the ESP32 and various other components to function well. If offers the following hardware security learnings:

* Identifying UART PINS and 'sniffing' them;
* Identifying I2C PINS and 'sniffing' them;
* Taking off the external EEPROM and reading its external memory;
* Dumping the ESP32 firwmare to identify board information;
* A basic timing attack against the PIN protection.
